## Pomodoro Clock -  A Free Code Camp project

This is the 2nd of the "Advanced" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 
The key challenge in both the vanilla JS and React versions of this project were 
around building a clock in JavaScript. Initially it was quite hard to wrap my 
head around the first time, but upon rebuilding the clock in React, it was 
relatively simple. The key part of this project came down to appropriately using 
the `setInterval` function. 

The interesting part about working on this project is that I use the Pomodoro 
technique to study. Previously I had been using a site called 
[Tomato Timers](http://tomatotimers.com/), whereas now I can use my own Pomodoro
clock. Ideally I would like to host this on my domain for easy access. It would 
also be cool to look into Local Storage to track how many "Pomodoros" I do. 

 **User Stories:**
 - [x] I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 
 minutes has elapsed.
 - [x] I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
 - [x] I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

 **Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Building a clock in React
* Using and clearing setInterval
* Linking the main clock, break clock and tally
* Created a "Pause" function in a clock

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `yarn`
 2. Run: `yarn start`
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can see a vanilla JS version of this

*This project was retired in July 2018.*
