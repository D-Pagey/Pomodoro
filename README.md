## Pomodoro Clock -  A Free Code Camp project

 **User Stories:**
 - [x] I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
 - [x] I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
 - [x] I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

This is the 2nd of the Advanced Front End projects on FreeCodeCamp. The key challenge
revolved around building a clock in JavaScript, which essentially came down to
appropriately using the setInterval function.

I have fulfilled the user stories however, there are still quite a few things I
would like to improve on the app. For starters, I would like to make the Pause button
functional. I would also like a different notification for the end of a timer.
